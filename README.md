# PCBench

## Dependencies
1. numpy

## Extract PCB information
To extract PCB information, please call `PCB` in `extract_kicad.py`. Here is an example code:
```
kicad_filename = "./benchmarks/real_world/1bitsy.kicad_pcb"
pcb = PCB(kicad_filename)
```

The extracted infomation are stored in `PCB` class, it includes following PCB inforamtion:
1. layers
2. boundary lines (now it only support straight lines, arcs need to be added later)
3. circuit range: min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y
4. net: clearance, trace width, via diameter, vias drill diameter, microvia diameter, microvia drill diameter, pads information
5. wires
6. vias
Note that pad information includes: center xy coordinate, pad vertices xy coordinates, pad size, pad layer, if the pad is drill hole

## Clean up data
Run `python PCB_cleaner.py kicad_file_path`. It will output a `.kicad_pcb file` that is generated by cleaned PCB in the folder `benchmarks/processed_kicad`.

The current clean up includes:
1. delete incomplete wires
2. delete isolated vias
3. convert isolated pad to obstacles
