# Dataset of PCB designs
This folder stores all the PCB design files including the raw files (kicad and eagle files) that we scrape directly from different sources, the cleaned files and stored in kicak format, and final JSON files that we use to store routing informations that can be used for ML tasks. [This repo](https://github.com/SergioGasquez/awesome-electronic-engineering#kicad) list learning resources for PCB or electronic designs. 

## find and upload PCB designs

To upload the circuit to this folder, please
1. upload the found circuit from different sources to the folder `raw`. Please refer this [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10nzUBFvauhISvmaXDbtiUpjhvJx0_DutUYc8_EI8eA8/edit) about where to find the circuit.
2. add the meta information of the uploaded circuit to `metadata.json` in the root folder, you can find the requirement and example for this meta info [here](https://pcbench.slab.com/posts/json-for-board-metadata-wqa2wdrc). 
3. run `python PCB_cleaner.py kicad_file_path`. It will output a `.kicad_pcb` file to the folder `PCBs/cleaned` that is generated by cleaned PCB. Note that the clean-up script currently only works for kicad files. For eagle files, just ignore this and following steps for now.
4. open the cleaned-up `.kicad_pcb` file in `PCBs/cleaned` folder using KiCAD and check if the clean up is correct. Please refer to this [issue](https://github.com/ybiao-he/PCBench/issues/1) about criterias of correctness.

Note that 
1. if the souce file is from KiCAD version 5, please put `.kicad_pcb` file in the folder, and if the source file is from KiCAD version 6, please put `.kicad_pcb` and `.pro` file in the folder. 
2. if you meet any issues when uploading PCB designs or run our scripts for cleaning up the data, please report the issue to [github issues of this repo](https://github.com/ybiao-he/PCBench/issues).
