## BRD Files

This is the root directory for a collection of subdirectories containing PCBs from Sparkfun. I've taken the liberty of using the KiCad software to import these projects from EAGLE CAD. The files generated from the import process are contained in a subdirectory of each project called `Kicad/`. I've also ran the cleaning script on the `.kicad_pcb` files generated by the import process, so a `processed.kicad_pcb` file is also present in these directories.

The import process appears to consistently produce a few types of errors:
1. Unrouted nets are present in the boards. Some nets *may be* genuinely unrouted (manual review of these limited number of boards does not indicate this, however), but often it appears that there are little "stubs" that lie along the same plane as a fully routed trace. As far as I can tell, it's like it laid the same wire twice, but didn't finish one. These do not seem to be a big concern, and should be reliably removed by cleaning script, along with any *true* unrouted nets.
2. There are layers used by EAGLE that are not supported by KiCad (e.g. 'Keepout' layers). An alert window in the KiCad software indicates that they have been converted to 'User' layers after the import finished.
3. There are DRC errors present in some boards. Common examples include "track too close to copper item" and "Pad too close to pad". These are left unresolved even post cleaning.
