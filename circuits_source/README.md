# PCB design source files
This folder stores all the PCB design sources files we scrape from different sources. [This repo](https://github.com/SergioGasquez/awesome-electronic-engineering#kicad) list learning resources for PCB or electronic designs. 

## find and upload PCB designs

To upload the circuit to this folder, please
1. upload the found circuit from different sources to its corresponding subfolder (Adafruit, Sparkfun, ..., etc.). Please refer this [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10nzUBFvauhISvmaXDbtiUpjhvJx0_DutUYc8_EI8eA8/edit) about where to find the circuit.
2. add the meta information of the uploaded circuit to `metadata.json` in each subfolder, you can find the requirement and example for this meta info [here](https://pcbench.slab.com/posts/json-for-board-metadata-wqa2wdrc). 
3. run `python PCB_cleaner.py kicad_file_path`. It will output a `.kicad_pcb` file to the folder `benchmarks/processed_kicad` that is generated by cleaned PCB. Note that the clean-up script currently only works for kicad files. For eagle files, just ignore this and following steps for now.
4. open the cleaned-up `.kicad_pcb` file in `benchmarks/processed_kicad` folder using KiCAD and check if the clean up is correct. Please refer to this [issue](https://github.com/ybiao-he/PCBench/issues/1) about criterias of correctness. \

Note that 
1. if the souce file is from KiCAD version 5, please put `.kicad_pcb` file in the folder, and if the source file is from KiCAD version 6, please put `.kicad_pcb` and `.pro` file in the folder. 
2. if you want to upload eagle files from a source (for example Adafruit), please create a subfolder for kicad file and another folder of eagle files. Just like we did in `Sparkfun` folder.
3. if you meet any issues when uploading PCB designs or run our scripts for cleaning up the data, please report the issue to [github issues of this repo] (https://github.com/ybiao-he/PCBench/issues).
